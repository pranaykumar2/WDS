- **Compliance with Regulations:** Various regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), mandate specific security controls for protecting user data. Web security compliance is essential to avoid legal and financial penalties.

#### b) Discuss three common web security threats and their potential impact on an enterprise. (10 Marks)

1. **Phishing:** Attackers use deceptive techniques, such as fake websites and emails, to trick users into revealing sensitive information. **Impact:** Financial losses, data breaches, reputational damage.
2. **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Malicious code is injected into web application inputs to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification. **Impact:** Data breaches, system compromise, financial losses.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into websites to compromise user interactions, steal sensitive information, or hijack user sessions. **Impact:** Data theft, session hijacking, website defacement.

#### c) Explain the concept of client-centric security and how it's becoming increasingly relevant in modern web applications. (5 Marks)

**Client-centric security** focuses on securing the user's web browser and its interactions with web applications. Traditionally, security measures were primarily implemented on the server-side. However, with the rise of complex web applications and client-side technologies like JavaScript, the focus has shifted towards securing the client-side as well.

**Relevance:**

- **Increased Client-Side Complexity:** Modern web applications heavily rely on client-side code execution. This introduces new vulnerabilities that require client-centric security measures for mitigation.
- **Protection Against Client-Side Attacks:** Many attacks, such as XSS and client-side injection, target vulnerabilities in the user's browser. Client-centric security aims to prevent and mitigate these attacks.
- **Enhanced User Privacy:** Client-centric security focuses on empowering users to control their data and privacy. This includes techniques like browser privacy extensions and client-side encryption.

### Question 2: Securing the Communication Channel (20 Marks)

#### a) Explain the importance of using HTTPS to secure communication between a web server and a web browser. (5 Marks)

**HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol used for secure communication over a computer network. It encrypts the data transmitted between the web server and the web browser, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.

**Importance:**

- **Confidentiality:** HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between the server and the client remains private and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.
- **Integrity:** HTTPS guarantees that the data transmitted is not altered in transit, preventing tampering and ensuring data reliability.
- **Authentication:** HTTPS uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the web server, assuring users they are communicating with the intended website and not a malicious imposter.

#### b) Explain the role of SSL/TLS in HTTPS and describe how it ensures secure communication. (10 Marks)

**SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a network. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to establish an encrypted connection between the web server and the web browser.

**How SSL/TLS ensures secure communication:**

1. **Handshake Protocol:** The server and client exchange digital certificates to verify each other's identities and establish a secure session.
2. **Symmetric Encryption:** Once the handshake is complete, a symmetric encryption key is generated and used to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted during the session.
3. **Message Authentication:** Each message exchanged is authenticated using a message authentication code (MAC), ensuring message integrity and preventing tampering.

#### c) Describe two potential security issues that can arise despite using HTTPS and discuss ways to mitigate them. (5 Marks)

1. **Insecure Configuration:** HTTPS effectiveness depends on proper server configuration. Using weak ciphers, outdated SSL/TLS versions, or self-signed certificates can weaken security. **Mitigation:** Use strong ciphers, enforce the latest TLS version, obtain certificates from trusted certificate authorities (CAs).
2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers can potentially intercept HTTPS traffic if they can compromise the CA or the user's device. **Mitigation:** Implement certificate pinning, use certificate transparency logs, educate users about phishing attempts.

### Question 3: Preventing Unauthorized Access (20 Marks)

#### a) Define authentication, authorization, and session management in the context of web application security. Explain how these mechanisms work together to prevent unauthorized access. (10 Marks)

**Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user who claims to be a specific individual or entity. This typically involves checking the user's credentials, such as a username and password, against a database of known users.

**Authorization:** The process of determining what a user is allowed to do after they have been authenticated. This typically involves checking the user's permissions against a list of allowed actions or resources.

**Session Management:** The process of managing the user's interactions with the web application after they have been authenticated. This typically involves tracking the user's session ID, managing session timeouts, and preventing session hijacking.

**Interplay:**

1. **Authentication establishes identity.**
2. **Authorization determines access rights based on the verified identity.**
3. **Session management maintains a secure connection and tracks user activity within the authorized scope.**

#### b) Discuss two practical methods for securing the authentication process in a web application. (5 Marks)

1. **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce password complexity requirements, minimum length, and regular password changes. Use password hashing and salting to protect stored passwords.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require users to provide an additional factor of authentication beyond their password, such as a one-time code from a mobile app or a hardware token. This adds an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

#### c) Explain what a session hijacking attack is and describe two techniques that can be used to harden session management mechanisms against such attacks. (5 Marks)

**Session Hijacking:** An attack where an attacker steals a user's session ID, allowing them to impersonate the user and access the user's account.

**Hardening Techniques:**

1. **HTTPS for Session ID Exchange:** Ensure that the session ID is only transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection to prevent eavesdropping.
2. **Session ID Rotation:** Regenerate the session ID periodically, especially after privilege level changes or sensitive actions, to reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.

### Question 4: Securely Handling Untrusted Data (20 Marks)

#### a) Explain what an injection attack is and discuss why it is considered a major web security threat. (5 Marks)

**Injection attack:** Occurs when malicious data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

**Threat Significance:**

- **Data Breaches:** Injection attacks can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as user credentials, financial information, and proprietary business data.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can exploit injection vulnerabilities to gain control of the web server or underlying systems, potentially leading to data manipulation, malware installation, or complete system takeover.
- **Reputational Damage:** Injection attacks can result in significant financial losses, legal consequences, and reputational damage for organizations.

#### b) Describe two types of server-side injection attacks and provide examples of each using code snippets. (10 Marks)

**1. SQL Injection (SQLi):**

- **Description:** Malicious SQL code is inserted into data inputs that are used to construct database queries.
    
- **Example (PHP):**
    
    ```
    // Vulnerable Code:
    $username = $_GET["username"];
    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";
    
    // Attacker Input:
    username = ' OR '1'='1
    
    // Resulting Query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
    ```
    
    In this example, the attacker's input modifies the query to bypass authentication and retrieve all user records.
    

**2. OS Command Injection:**

- **Description:** Attackers inject operating system commands into data inputs that are executed by the web server.
    
- **Example (Java):**
    
    ```
    // Vulnerable Code:
    String filename = request.getParameter("filename");
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cat " + filename);
    
    // Attacker Input:
    filename = somefile.txt; rm -rf /
    
    // Resulting Command:
    cat somefile.txt; rm -rf /
    ```
    
    The attacker's input adds a malicious command to delete all files in the root directory.
    

#### c) Discuss three general defense strategies for preventing injection attacks in web applications. (5 Marks)

1. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected data types and formats. This helps prevent malicious data from being interpreted as commands or queries.
2. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Use parameterized queries for database interactions. This technique separates data from commands, preventing attackers from injecting malicious code into the query structure.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause if they successfully exploit an injection vulnerability.

### Question 5: Administration of Users (20 Marks)

#### a) Explain the importance of robust user administration practices in database security. (5 Marks)

**Robust user administration** is crucial for maintaining database security and integrity by controlling user access and privileges. This includes creating, managing, and deleting user accounts; assigning appropriate roles and permissions; and enforcing strong password policies.

**Importance:**

- **Preventing Unauthorized Access:** Strict user administration controls help ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and database functionalities.
- **Minimizing Data Breaches:** By limiting user privileges, organizations reduce the potential impact of a security breach or insider threat.
- **Compliance with Regulations:** Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA, often mandate specific user administration practices for protecting sensitive data.

#### b) Describe the two main authentication methods supported by SQL Server. Discuss their strengths and weaknesses. (10 Marks)

**1. Windows Authentication:**

- **Description:** Relies on the Windows operating system's authentication mechanisms, such as Active Directory, to verify user identities. Users authenticate using their Windows domain credentials.
- **Strengths:**
    - Enhanced security due to integration with OS-level security policies.
    - Supports multi-factor authentication for stronger protection.
    - Simplifies user management by centralizing authentication within the Windows domain.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Limited to environments where Windows authentication is feasible.
    - Can be more complex to configure than SQL Server authentication.

**2. SQL Server Authentication:**

- **Description:** Users authenticate using SQL Server logins and passwords managed within the SQL Server instance.
- **Strengths:**
    - Easier to configure than Windows authentication.
    - Suitable for environments where Windows authentication is not an option.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Less secure than Windows authentication, as passwords are managed within SQL Server.
    - Requires separate user management for SQL Server logins, which can be cumbersome.

#### c) Discuss the concept of roles in database user administration. Explain how roles can be used to simplify privilege management and enforce the principle of least privilege. (5 Marks)

**Roles:** A predefined set of permissions that can be granted to users or other roles. Roles simplify privilege management by grouping related permissions and allowing administrators to assign permissions to roles rather than individual users.

**Benefits for Privilege Management:**

- **Simplification:** Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, administrators can assign roles that encapsulate the necessary permissions for specific job functions or responsibilities.
- **Consistency:** Using roles ensures that users with similar job functions have consistent access rights, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and security gaps.
- **Least Privilege Enforcement:** Roles can be designed to grant only the minimum privileges required for a particular task or job function, adhering to the principle of least privilege and minimizing the potential impact of a security breach.
