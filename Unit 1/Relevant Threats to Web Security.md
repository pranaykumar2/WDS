### 1. Phishing

- Phishing attacks deceive users into disclosing sensitive information, like account numbers, credit card data, and login credentials.
- Successful phishing can give criminals access to corporate data.
- Phishing is often executed through emails that appear legitimate, directing users to fake websites designed to steal their credentials.

### 2. Ransomware

- Ransomware is malicious software that blocks access to a victim's data or computer system, holding it hostage.
- Attackers demand payment to restore access.
- Ransomware can spread through various means, including:
    - **Phishing emails:** These emails may contain links to malicious websites or attachments that download ransomware onto the victim's device.
    - **Exploiting software vulnerabilities:** Attackers can take advantage of security holes in software to install ransomware.
    - **Malicious websites:** Visiting compromised websites can lead to unintentional ransomware downloads.

### 3. SQL Injection

- SQL injection targets web applications that use databases.
- Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web forms or input fields by injecting malicious SQL code.
- This injected code can manipulate database queries, allowing attackers to:
    - Retrieve sensitive data, like customer files and financial information.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Gain unauthorized access to the database server.

### 4. Cross-site scripting (XSS)

- XSS attacks target vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious scripts onto trusted websites.
- When a user visits the compromised website, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- This enables attackers to:
    - Steal sensitive information, such as cookies and session IDs.
    - Hijack user sessions.
    - Modify website content.
    - Launch further attacks.

### 5. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack

- DDoS attacks flood a web server with a massive volume of traffic from multiple sources, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- Attackers often utilize botnets—networks of compromised computers—to generate the overwhelming traffic.
- Motivations for DDoS attacks include:
    - Disrupting business operations.
    - Extortion.
    - Hacktivism.

### 6. Viruses and Worms

- Viruses and worms are malicious programs that self-replicate and spread across computers and networks.
- They exploit software vulnerabilities to infect systems and can cause a range of problems, including:
    - Data loss.
    - System crashes.
    - Network slowdowns.
- Viruses often require user interaction to spread (e.g., opening an infected file), while worms can propagate automatically across networks.

### 7. Spyware

- Spyware covertly gathers user data without their consent.
- It can collect sensitive information like passwords, financial data, and browsing history.
- Spyware often operates in the background, making detection difficult.
- It can be distributed through various channels, including:
    - Malicious websites.
    - Software downloads.
    - Email attachments.

The sources emphasize the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate these threats. This includes using strong passwords, keeping software updated, being cautious of suspicious emails and websites, and employing security software like firewalls and antivirus programs.
