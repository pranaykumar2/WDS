### What are Injection Attacks?

**Injection attacks** exploit vulnerabilities in how applications handle user input. An attacker injects malicious code into data sent to the application, which then gets interpreted and executed by the system, potentially leading to:

- **Compromised Systems:** Attackers could execute operating system commands on the target machine.
- **Data Breaches:** Sensitive data can be accessed or stolen by the attacker.
- **Hijacked Accounts:** Attackers could gain control of user accounts or even take over entire services.
- **Forced Actions:** Legitimate users might be forced to perform actions on behalf of the attacker.

### Common Types of Injection Attacks

The sources focus on several types of injection attacks:

1. **OS Command Injection:** Malicious code is injected into parameters that are executed as system commands. For example, adding characters like ';' or '|' to a filename could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
2. **SQL Injection (SQLi):** This attack targets applications that interact with databases. Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries, manipulating the database to extract data, modify content, or even gain full control of the database server.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts are injected into websites, often exploiting vulnerabilities in how user input is handled. When other users visit the compromised site, their browsers execute the injected code, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malware distribution.

### Historical Context (From External Sources)

**Note:** The following information is not from the provided sources and you may want to independently verify it.

Over time, injection attacks have evolved alongside technology trends and security practices:

- **Early Web Applications (1990s-early 2000s):** As web applications gained popularity, basic SQL injection techniques emerged. Attackers exploited poorly sanitized input fields to manipulate database queries.
- **Rise of XSS (late 1990s-2000s):** With the increasing use of client-side scripting languages like JavaScript, XSS attacks became prevalent. Attackers found ways to inject malicious scripts into websites, compromising user accounts and stealing sensitive information.
- **Sophisticated Techniques (2010s-present):** As security awareness grew, attackers developed more sophisticated techniques like blind SQL injection, which relies on observing the application's behavior to extract data. Automated tools and frameworks also emerged, making it easier for attackers to launch large-scale injection attacks.

### Investigating Injection Attacks Over Time

When investigating injection attacks, consider the historical context to understand the techniques used and the potential impact:

1. **Identify the Type of Attack:** Determine whether it's SQLi, XSS, OS command injection, or another type. The attack vector and the payload will offer clues.
2. **Analyze the Timeline:** Determine when the attack likely occurred, the duration of the attack, and any associated events (e.g., changes in user behavior, unusual data access patterns).
3. **Examine the Attack Vector:** Identify the entry point for the attack (e.g., a web form, an API endpoint). Analyze how the application handles user input and if there are vulnerabilities in input validation or sanitization.
4. **Decode the Payload:** Analyze the malicious code injected by the attacker. Understanding the payload can reveal the attacker's goals, the techniques used, and the potential impact of the attack.
5. **Investigate the Impact:** Assess the damage caused by the attack, including data breaches, compromised accounts, or system downtime. Determine if any sensitive data was accessed or exfiltrated.
6. **Review Security Measures:** Evaluate the existing security controls and identify weaknesses that allowed the attack to succeed. This might involve reviewing code for vulnerabilities, checking logging configurations, and assessing security policies.

### Conclusion

Investigating injection attacks requires a combination of technical skills and historical awareness. By understanding the evolving nature of these attacks, security professionals can better identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and protect systems from future exploitation.
